<h1> Form uploading a CSV File in Java Script </h1>

 *<h2>simulation of buying a trip</h2>*
*<h2>This is the form by which we load the .CSV file with the excursions.* :blue_book:</h2>
>from the series: learning the basics of Java script  :muscle:

----

* Drag the file with the [.csv format](https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/) you have an example in my file
* then the excursions will come
* you can choose the excursion you want and enter the number of people 
  and go to the order
* the order shows what you ordered and how much it costs, you must enter the correct data


  
The task was:
- loading excursions and displaying them in the panel
- adding excursions to the order
- form validation

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* and then "go live" is enough

:computer: TECHNOLOGIES : HTML, CSS and  JS.
